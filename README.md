# Life_Expectancy_GDP
This project uses data from the WHO to visualize and anaylyze relationships between GDP and life expectancy for 6 different countries

Goals:
* Use seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations
* Become familiar with presenting and sharing data visualizations
* Preprocess, explore, and analyze data

Data:
* WHO website: Country, Year, Life expectancy at birth (years), GDP
* countries: ['Chile' 'China' 'Germany' 'Mexico' 'United States of America' 'Zimbabwe']
* years: 2000-2015

Analysis:
* life expectancy: change over time per country, average, median and range
* GDP: change over time per country, average, median and range
* ANOVA to compare life expectancy and GDP over 15 years for 6 countries
* Tukey's HSD if significant differences in either exist

Visualization:
* scatter plot: change over time for age and GDP
* box and whisker plot: age and GDP between countries
